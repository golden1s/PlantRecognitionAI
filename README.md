# PlantRecognitionAI
This is my repository for the IT 254 group project.

An Arduino-powered AI system that identifies plant species using sensors and camera input, optimized for the best performance. It reads environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and light levels through connected sensors, allowing it to assess the plant’s surroundings. Based on the identified species and environmental conditions, the system provides the best plant care suggestions to help maintain optimal growth and health. Since it runs on Arduino, PlantRecognitionAI is compatible with virtually all devices, making it accessible and easy to use anywhere.

The YouTube links below are videos that demonstrate how to make and use the soil moisture Arduino build
