# PlantRecognitionAI
This is my repository for the IT 254 group project.

An Arduino-powered AI system that identifies plant species using sensors like the DHT11 sensor, optimized for the best performance. It reads environmental data such as humidity through connected sensors, allowing it to assess the plant’s surroundings. Based on the identified species and environmental conditions, the system provides the best plant care suggestions to help maintain optimal growth and health. Since it runs on Arduino, PlantRecognitionAI is compatible with virtually all devices, making it accessible and easy to use anywhere.

All of this is made by my group and me with the help of researching similar projects and testing different diagrams using Wokwi and Tinkercad

The YouTube links below are videos that demonstrate create the Arduino circuit and use it
